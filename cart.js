/* Summary:

Errors and Corrections: (see comments in code body for more context)

1. Fixed the loop in "calculate total" by replacing <= with <

2. Corrected applyDiscount formula, and added a validity check.

3. Fixed invalid totals in generateRecipt


Debugging tools helped by allowing for the use of breakpoints to stop functions, see what was happening, and then find a solution
